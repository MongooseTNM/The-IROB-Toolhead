# The-IROB-Toolhead
## AKA The I-Ripped-Off-Burgo Toolhead
Basically a redesign of the Takeoff Toolhead by Kizime123 

Specs:
 - Dual 4028 fans
 - Dragon UHF
 - Sherpa Mini compatibility
 - 3010 heatbreak fan
 - Custom Klicky "tap" solution
 - 6mm belts

warning: I designed this toolhead for some random m3 heat set inserts I had so they are not the voron standard. The holes for the heat sets are 4.2mm as opposed to the > 4.5mm standard size.
